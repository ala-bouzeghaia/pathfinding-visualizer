# Pathfinding Visualizer

A web-based application that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in action. This project helps users understand how different pathfinding algorithms work through interactive visualization.

## Features

- Interactive grid system
- Multiple pathfinding algorithms including:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A\* Search
  - Breadth-First Search
- Real-time visualization
- Ability to create walls and obstacles

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinding-visualizer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd pathfinding-visualizer
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Click and drag to create walls
2. Select a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu
3. Set start and end points
4. Click 'Visualize' to see the algorithm in action
